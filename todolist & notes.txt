[] Question: If you want to roll back the repo do a previous commit e.g. the most recent one minus 1. How would you do that?

- 1250px final image width for games & drinks titles



Use chrome not firefox when analyzing a website with dev tools.
Chrome has better dev tools.

Create the structure with html & css first.
Add the images last after all the image placeholder divs etc. are in the right places.

Right click on any elemenet e.g. some text to find out the size.
Just mouse over the code in the devtools. easier.

- how to check the padding around the logo? will manually do it later by having tab windows side by side
- For now just add more content
