Use chrome not firefox when analyzing a website with dev tools.
Chrome has better dev tools.

Create the structure with html & css first.
Add the images last after all the image placeholder divs etc. are in the right places.

Right click on any elemenet e.g. some text to find out the size.
Just mouse over the code in the devtools. easier.

- how to check the padding around the logo? will manually do it later by having tab windows side by side
- For now just add more content
